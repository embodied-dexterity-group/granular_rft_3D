# granular_rft_3D

This code introduces a method for implementing Granular Resistive Force Theory (RFT) in three dimensions. This code was developed in conjunction with the journal publication "Granular Resistive Force Theory Implementation for Three-Dimensional Trajectories," in Robotics and Automation Letters April 2021. (DOI: 10.1109/LRA.2021.3057052).
